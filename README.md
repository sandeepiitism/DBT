Key Tasks:

1. Import Data into Data Warehouse:
- Import Airbnb data from the provided source into Snowflake data warehouse.
- Ensure the data is properly formatted and ready for analysis.

2. Prepare Data for Analysis Tools:
- Make the imported data accessible for tools like DVT (Data Visualization Tool).
- Configure connectivity between Snowflake and DVT for seamless data visualization.

3. Data Cleansing and Transformation:
- Perform data cleansing to eliminate inconsistencies and errors.
- Implement necessary transformations on the data to meet analytical requirements.
- Ensure data is formatted correctly for export and analysis.

4. Export Data to External Tools (e.g., FBI):
- Export transformed data to external tools such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for analysis.
- Pipeline Development and Testing:

5. Develop a robust data pipeline architecture.
- Ensure the pipeline is well-tested to handle various scenarios and edge cases.
- Implement monitoring mechanisms to track pipeline performance and data quality.
- Establish alerting systems for detecting and addressing pipeline errors or anomalies.

6. Version Control and Collaboration:
- Implement version control for the pipeline code to track changes and facilitate collaboration.
- Ensure the pipeline code is well-documented for ease of understanding and maintenance.

7. Dependency Management:
- Define explicit dependencies between pipeline components to ensure correct execution order.
- Implement features for easy exploration and overview of dependencies.

8. Additional Requirements:
- Handle incremental updates for event-based tables to efficiently manage new data.
- Implement mechanisms for managing slowly changing dimensions to maintain historical data integrity.

9. Setup and Configuration:
- Guide users through the setup process, including Snowflake registration and DVT installation.
- Provide tutorials for installing DVT on both Windows and Mac platforms.

10. Readiness for Analytics:
- Ensure the data infrastructure is optimized for analytics and meets the specific requirements outlined.
- Prepare the environment for advanced analytics tasks and business logic development.
